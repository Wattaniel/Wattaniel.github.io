<h2>Personal Development</h2>
<p>My three strengths are my <i>creativity, open mindedness and  resourcefulness.</i> I've been developing myself in these areas by raeding many books to gain new ideas and knowledge. 
I've also open myself up to different cultures to gain more understanding by watching documentaries and vlogs about places and people around the world. 
I have become more resourceful by taking advantage of opportunities, embracing different experiences in my life, embracing my passions,
appreciating constraints, having clear beliefs, taking calculated risks, and being more driven by my goals then by what other people think.

<p>As a reader, I decided to start reading self development books; the one I started with is The Twelve Pillars by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener. 
This experience has taught my mnay things, so I will only be focusing on chapters 4 to 7 which I found to be really enlightening.</p>       
<br>
<b><p>The first lesson I learned is “The major reason for setting a goal is for what it makes of you to accomplish it.”</p></b>
<p>It stated that in order to achieve your goals is to write them down. By doing this, it allows you to envision ways to accomplish them as
"because now your mind is cognitively aware of them so your mind then gets to work achieving them." I've applied this to my life by writing down my 
most important goals, that is my long-range, mid-range, short range and micro range goals and then apply consistent effort into making them a reality.</p>

<br><b><p>The second lesson I learned is “Every day has many opportunities, but only one best opportunity.”</p></b>
<p>It stated that "Days are expensive. When you spend a day you have one less day to spend. So make sure you spend each one wisely."
It also stated "your day is being spent wisely if it is being spent in the best way possible. Every day has many opportunities, but only one best 
opportunity. Your best opportunities are those that align with your overall goals and should be what you spend your time on.
I applied this to my everyday life by making sure to spend more time on my goals each day as well as making time for hobbies in
my busy school schedule.</p><br>

<b><p>The third lesson I learned is “Surround Yourself With the Best People”</p></b>
<p>It stated that you should “surround yourself with winners, successful people who exhibit and  live consistent to 
    values and skills you want to acquire and develop." This is so as the people you are with can influence your attitude, mindset and behaviour.
    It also states that you should ask yourself the following: <br>"Who am I around? What effectare they having on me? What have they got me reading? 
    What have they got me saying? Where do they have me going? What do they have me thinking? And most 
    importantly, what do they have me becoming? Then ask yourself the big question: Is that okay?"
    From these questions, I was able to determine the type of people I should associate with.<br> This book also stated that
    "You place every person you meet into one of three categories: Disassociation, limited association, and expanded association."
    Based on this I decided whether the amount of time I spent with each person will challenge me to become the type of person I want to be and decided if
    I should either stop associating, limit association with or expand my association.</p><br>

<b><p>The fourth lesson I learnt is “Formal education will make you a living. Self-education will make you a fortune.”</p></b>
<p>It states "If someone is going down the wrong path, he doesn't need motivation to speed him up. He needs education to turn him around. 
    Learning is the beginning of wealth. Learning is the beginning of health. Learning is the beginning of spirituality. Searching and 
    learning is where the miracle process all begins. Well, that education is self-education. Most of life is lived after your 
    formal education. That means the rest is up to you."<br> From this, I learnt that if I want to suceed in life, I should consider self education which is is what you teach yourself. This is so as what 
    you learn in life is what causes you to constantly improve and grow.</p><br>
